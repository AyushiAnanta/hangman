Overview

This Hangman game brings the classic word-guessing challenge to the web using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players guess letters to uncover a hidden word before the hangman is fully drawn.


How to Play

1. Start the Game: The game initializes with a random word and displays a clue.
2. Make a Guess: Click on the letters displayed to guess the word. Correct guesses fill in the word, while wrong guesses draw parts of the hangman.
3. Win or Lose: Keep guessing until you either reveal the entire word (win) or the hangman is fully drawn (lose).
4. Play Again: Use the refresh button to start a new game with a different word and clue.
